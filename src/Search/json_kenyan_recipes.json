Lightly dust the rolling surface to prevent the\ndough from sticking onto the working surface.\nFlatten the balls and apply a little oil onto the\nsurface of each of the spread dough and stack\nthree pieces together (the oil will help the layers\nto separate later).\n?  Roll out each stack into thin discs.\n?  Place a circular plate on the rolled-out dough\nand trim the edges to form a circle the size of the\nplate.\n?  Place a pan on the fire on high heat for 1 minute.\n?  Place the rolled-out dough onto the hot pan and\nlightly cook each side for 1 minute.\n?

Spread the next batch of stacked discs and cook for\n1 minute on each side.\nTo make the paste:\n?  The paste is used to seal the envelopes as a bond\u0002ing agent.\n?  Mix 3/4 cup of wheat flour and 3/4 cup of water to\nmake a paste.\n?  Make the casings using the paste to bond and seal\nthe edges.\n?  Fold the layers previously covered into 2, cut into\nhalf and then into quarters.\n?  Take a quarter and fold it into a samosa case and\napply the paste to hold the edges together.\n?  Repeat this for the rest of the batches.\nFilling the Samosa:\n?  ?  Take each piece and fill in the pocket in the\npreviously prepared vegetables.\n?  ?  Use the wheat flour water paste to seal the\nsamosa case.\nCooking:\n?  Put the remaining oil onto a pan and heat for 17\nminutes or until the oil bubbles when a pinch of\ndough is dropped in the oil.\n?  Drop the samosa gently into the oil and cook each\nside for 2 minutes until golden brown.\n?
